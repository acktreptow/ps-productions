# PlayStation Productions React Bootstrap Homepage

This homepage for PlayStation's TV and movie division that uses both React and Bootstrap.

## Technologies Used:

- React
- Bootstrap
- CSS
- HTML

## Project Overview

This project was primarily for getting first-hand experience with Bootstrap in React, and to see how it differs from vanilla Bootstrap.

It also helped further ingrain the library's generally accepted standards. For example, I ensured that each section was broken up into their own component, which adhere to DRY by utilizing techniques like the .map higher-order function for the arrays of objects.

Additionally, I used this opportunity to implement Bootstrap components I hadn't previously used. Like a carousel to showcase TV shows and movies. Finally, I also used custom CSS to give some components a PlayStation-inspired background color. A little bit went a long way from preventing the homepage from looking too 'Bootstrappy'.

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository (for Git): `git clone https://github.com/acktreptow/ps-productions.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd ps-productions`
3. Type `npm i` into the command line to ensure all dependencies are installed
4. Type `npm start` into the command line to view it in your preferred browser

## Future Enhancements

Unlikely, as I achieved my goal of creating a responsive homepage that uses both React and Bootstrap.
