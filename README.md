# PlayStation Productions React Bootstrap Homepage

This homepage for PlayStation's TV and movie division that uses both React and Bootstrap.

## Technologies Used:

- React
- Bootstrap
- CSS
- HTML

## Project Overview

This was an interesting project to complete. Primarily because I got first-hand experience with Bootstrap for React and how that differs to using vanilla Bootstrap.

It also gave me more experience in React, which helped further ingrain the library's generally accepted standards. For example, I ensured that all parts of the homepage were broken up into their own, correctly formatted components. The components also adhere to DRY by utilizing techniques like the map higher-order function for the arrays of objects.

Finally, I used this opportunity to implement Bootstrap components I hadn't used before. For example, I applied a carousel to showcase the TV shows/movies that PlayStation Productions had already released. I also used custom CSS to give some components a PlayStation-inspired background color. A little bit went a long way from preventing the homepage from looking too 'Bootstrappy'.

I look forward to using these applications together again in future, more advanced projects.

## Future Enhancements

Barring unforeseen circumstances, I don't plan on updating this project as I have achieved my goal of creating a responsive homepage that uses both React and Bootstrap.
