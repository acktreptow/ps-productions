# PlayStation Productions React Bootstrap Homepage

I have completed multiple projects in both React and Bootstrap, but none using both.

So welcome to PlayStation Productions! A homepage for PlayStation's TV and movie productions that uses React and Bootstrap.

## Technologies used:

- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- React

## Project Overview

This was an interesting project to complete. Primarily because I got first-hand experience with Bootstrap for React and how that differs to using vanilla Bootstrap.

It also gave me further experience in React and help polish my etiquette within the library. For example, I ensured that all parts of the homepage were broken up into their own, correctly formatted components. The components also adhere to DRY by utilizing techniques like the .map high-order-function for arrays.

It also gave me a chance to implement new Bootstrap components. For example, I used a carousel for the first time to showcase TV shows/movies that PlayStation Productions had already released. I decided to also use a little bit of custom CSS to give some components a more PlayStation-inspired background color. A little bit went a long way from preventing the homepage from looking too 'Bootstrappy'.

I look forward to using these applications together again in future projects.

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/acktreptow/ps-productions.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd ps-productions`
3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## Future Enhancements

Barring unforeseen circumstances, I don't plan on updating this project in the future as I have achieved my goal of creating a homepage that uses both React and Bootstrap.
